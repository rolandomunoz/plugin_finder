# Indexer

This Praat plug-in is a *search engine* which helps the user to find some specific annotations within a set of TextGrid files stored in a directory. Once a search is done, you can visualize the occurences ony-by-one in the TextGridEditor or extract them in a folder.

## Getting started


### 1. How to install it?

Before starting, make sure that you have Praat 6.0.30 or more on your computer. If not, download the the latest version of Praat ![here](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat). 

You can install the plug-in in two ways. 

#### 1.1 Copy the plug-in folder to Praat preferences

**Step 1:** Download the plug-in from this website. Then unzip it. 

**Step 2:** Drop the plug-in folder in the *praat preference* folder.

*On Mac* 

*On Windows*

*On Ubuntu*, go to `/home/rolando/.praat-dir`

**Step 3:** Open Praat again. In the Object menu, go to `Praat > Goodies`. You should see a submenu called `Indexer` 

#### 1.2 Run the set-up file



### 2. How to use it?

This plug-in is simple to use. You just need to follow three steps.

#### Step 1: Create an index

First, in the plug-in menu, use the `Create an index...` command to index the content of your TextGrid files. 
You can think of this command as a panoramic photo in the sense that all your annotations at a specific moment will be captured and stored in a file. 
The result file will be used by the other commands to make simple or complex queries about the content of the annotations. 

When you press on `Create an index...` a dialogue box will pop-up. In the `TextGrid folder` field, complete with the directory where your TextGrids are stored. 
Very often, projects organized TextGrid files in different subfolders within a *main folder*. In these cases, complete the `TextGrid folder` field with the path of the *main folder*.
Then, activate the `Recursive search` option. This way, any TextGrid below the main folder domain will be listed in the index.<br>
Finally, *empty intervals* are not considered as part of the annotations, so they are not tipically include in the index. 
If it is neccesary, you can revert this behaviour by using the **Include empty intervals** option.

When press on **Continue**, wait until a message appears. 
In the end, you will see a table object  called **index**.
This table contains the representation of all your indexed TextGrids.
This table is shown only for informantion purposes. You can remove it if want. 

#### Step 2: Make a query

Once an index is created, it is time for queries! When you query something, you ask if any TextGrid file contain a specific word or a sequence of letters. 
As we will see, this plug-in can perform different types of queries.

In the plug-in menu, go to `Query by tier name...`, a dialog box will appear.
In `Tier name`, pick the tier where the query will be made, then complete the `Search for` with the text you want find.
Use `Mode` to adjust the type of matching. There are severeal options. You can use  *is equal to*, *contains*, *starts with* or *starts with*.
But, you can also do a negative search using *is not equal*, *does not contain*, *does not start with* or *does not end with*. 
For more complex searches, you can use regex.

When press on **Continue**, wait until a message appears.
The message will tell you how many occurrences were found. 
Also, a query table will be shown in Praat Objects.
This contains details of the occurrences found. Feel free to remove it if you want.

Usually, you don't need to go back to step 1 each time you make a query. Step 2 can be realised as many times as neccesary!

#### Step 3: Do some actions!

After making a query, you can do somes tasks.

##### Browsing in your annotations
